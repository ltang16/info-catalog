# A Better Information Course Catalog for MIMS

## Summary

For this Info 202 implementation project, I decided to add a categorization structure for all Information graduate courses offered during the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 academic years, aimed at assisting MIMS students in their course search. The current Information catalog doesn't have a meaningful organizational scheme beyond separating courses into undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels, so I implemented a new one by creating a set of faceted metadata containing all relevant course information. The metadata for each course includes details such as the course unit count, description, and past and future timeslots, all displayed simultaneously to create as informative of an interface as possible without the user having to navigate to different webpages. This new category architecture enables filtering of the course catalog, helping the user find specific courses that fulfill a MIMS degree requirement, are applicable towards the Applied Data Science graduate certificate, or pertain to various topics. All components were built in React to create an online interactive webpage to house the catalog and its categorization scheme.

## Process

### Creating Faceted Metadata

Since I wanted users of this new site to be able to filter on three major course traits, my first goal was to determine which categories each course should be placed into. I began by storing all course details from the Information catalogs from 2024 - 2025 and 2025 - 2026 in a JSON file, as we did in the website building assignment, to provide the course data for the React application. Each course was represented by faceted metadata stored in a JSON object, with the following keys: an index to uniquely identify the course, the course ID, title, unit count, instructor, description, semester offered, timeslot, location, course type (core or non-core for the MIMS degree), the MIMS degree requirement fulfilled if any, applicability towards the Applied Data Science certificate, topics covered, and any additional information. Some facets could be multi-valued, in the event that the course was offered during multiple semesters and therefore had multiple possible instructors or timeslots. 

The MIMS degree requirement was one of the three major course traits acting as a filter and also produced a shallow hierarchy, in that courses could only be placed into a single exclusive and non-overlapping category -- they either did not fulfill any requirements, or fulfilled either the Technology requirement or the Social Science and Policy requirement. Eligibility towards the Applied Data Science certificate was another course trait that could be used as a filter, and similarly formed a shallow hierarchy where courses either were not applicable towards the certificate, or counted as an introductory data science course, an analytical methods and techniques of data science course, or an elective. For the final filtering trait, I created a new multi-valued facet to describe the topics covered by the course, such as "programming" or "artificial intelligence." Adding these topics was an exercise in creating new categories based solely on the course description, and ensuring that they were broad enough to apply to multiple courses since I wanted every single course to be assigned at least one topic. The rest of the facets were purely informational, in that they weren't used in the filtering functionality and merely provided additional details about the course that might be helpful for a MIMS student.

This faceted metadata structure helped me thoroughly describe the course collection for both informative and filtering purposes. The MIMS degree requirement, certificate eligibility, and topic facets formed a system of overlapping but equally-important categories for this collection (similarly to what we accomplished with the Algolia interface), rather than a singular hierarchical taxonomy that would have required a very rigid and complex ruleset to eventually divide all courses into their own unique categories. Additionally, these three facets acted as a way to parse a user's inherent search query into a combination of Boolean operations -- for example, a MIMS student searching for courses that are eligible for the Applied Data Science certificate and pertain to machine learning or data science would use the filters to produce the following conjunct of disjuncts: (MIMS degree requirement = null OR MIMS degree requirement = Technology OR MIMS degree requirement = Social Science and Policy) AND (DS certification = Introductory DS course OR DS certification = Applied Methods and Techniques of DS course OR DS certification = elective) AND (topic = machine learning OR topic = data science).

### Building the Catalog Webpage

I utilized my learnings from Info 253A and the React framework to build a website structure and enable interactivity for the catalog, as I wanted the user to be able to filter it according to their interests and even edit it per Professor Hearst's suggestions. After finishing the catalog JSON file, I imported it into the App.jsx file and created a state for it so that it was available to different app components as needed. 

 
 
 Rather than create a new catalog item for courses that were offered across multiple semesters, I allowed some facets (instructor, semester, timeslot, and location) to be multi-valued as needed, and represented them and the topics facet as arrays in the JSON file containing the catalog metadata. This allowed me to consolidate all relevant data into a single item for each course, keeping the catalog concise. I also ordered the timeslots from most to least recent to keep the most up-to-date information easily visually accessible for users.
