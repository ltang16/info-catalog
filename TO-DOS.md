TO-DO:  
[] create the JSON course catalog  
> [x] add all courses  
> [x] add "topics" metadata to all courses (as list) 
> [x] tag all applied data science certificate courses
> [ ] add "index" to each course? (Date.now() or UUID)

[x] build webpage structure 
> [x] maybe create new component for individual courses and use in overall app body
> [ ] create new components for course requirement + DS certificate filter buttons and topics filter buttons
> [x] create new component for catalog list -- need to pass filtered course list to this! will then pass individual course data to individual course component
> [ ] switch all button types to checkboxes and create toggle click functions!!! removes need for "all Info courses" button and improves aesthetics
> [ ] add state data for user-given course requirements, DS certificate eligibility, topics, and subsequent filtered catalog (single-select for course reqs and DS cert, and multi-select for topics)
> [ ] add new component for breadcrumbs? 

[ ] build catalog page CSS  
[ ] add form for course addition to catalog -- need to permanently edit JSON file
[ ] enable course item editing (ideally in place rather than sending to form at bottom...) -- also permanently edit JSON file
[x] create MIMs requirements filtering function and filter buttons
[x] create DS certificate filtering function and filter buttons
[ ] create course topic filtering function (MULTIPLE ALLOWED) and selection buttons
[ ] add breadcrumbs component and functions?
