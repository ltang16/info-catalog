TO-DO:  
[] create the JSON course catalog  
> [x] add all courses  
> [x] add "topics" metadata to all courses (as list) 
> [x] tag all applied data science certificate courses
> [ ] add "index" to each course? (Date.now() or UUID)

[ ] build webpage structure 
> [ ] maybe create new component for individual courses and use in overall app body
> [ ] create new components for course requirement filter buttons and topics filter buttons
> [ ] create new component for catalog list -- need to pass filtered course list to this! will then pass individual course data to individual course component

[ ] build catalog page CSS  
[ ] add form for course addition to catalog -- need to permanently edit JSON file
[ ] enable course item editing (ideally in place rather than sending to form at bottom...) -- also permanently edit JSON file
[ ] create categorization filtering function and filter buttons
[ ] create course topic filtering function (MULTIPLE ALLOWED) and selection buttons
[ ] 800+ word writeup :)  
[ ] host live demo on Netlify or something similar  
[x] start Github repo  
[ ] push all code to Github repo
